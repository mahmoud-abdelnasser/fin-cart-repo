# 📌 Prompt History

Below is a transparent log of the key prompts used during development.

---

## 1️⃣ Project Architecture Planning

**Prompt:**
I need to build a Quick Quote shipping calculator using React, TypeScript, and Material UI.
It should include a multi-step form, context state management, and optimized performance.
Can you suggest a clean scalable folder structure?

**Purpose:**
To design a scalable and maintainable folder structure aligned with senior-level frontend practices.

---

## 2️⃣ Multi-Step Form Optimization

**Prompt:**
How can I build a performant multi-step form using React Hook Form without triggering unnecessary re-renders?

**Purpose:**
To ensure the form architecture avoids performance bottlenecks and unnecessary page updates.

---

## 3️⃣ Validation Schema Design

**Prompt:**
Create a Zod schema for a shipping form where weight must be greater than zero and international shipping requires valid ISO country codes.

**Purpose:**
To define strong validation rules using schema-based validation.

---

## 4️⃣ Courier Highlight Logic

**Prompt:**
Given an array of couriers with price and deliveryTime, how can I determine the cheapest and fastest options efficiently in React?

**Purpose:**
To implement optimized comparison logic using memoization.

---

## 5️⃣ Performance Optimization

**Prompt:**
How would you optimize a React + MUI application for slow 3G networks in emerging markets?

**Purpose:**
To apply bundle size reduction, lazy loading, and performance best practices.

---

## 6️⃣ API Error Handling Strategy

**Prompt:**
What is a professional way to handle partial API failures in a multi-courier rate comparison system?

**Purpose:**
To design graceful error handling and retry mechanisms.

---

## 7️⃣ README Generation

**Prompt:**
Generate a senior-level README file explaining architecture, performance, and API error handling strategy.

**Purpose:**
To clearly communicate technical decisions and engineering considerations.

# ⚖️ AI Usage Philosophy

AI was used as:

- A productivity enhancer
- A brainstorming assistant
- A refactoring helper

AI was NOT used to:

- Blindly generate full application logic
- Replace engineering decisions
- Bypass understanding of implementation details

All architectural decisions, component design, and integration logic were reviewed and validated manually.

---

# ✅ Final Note

This project reflects independent engineering judgment, with AI used strictly as a development assistant.
